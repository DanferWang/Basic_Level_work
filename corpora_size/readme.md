## Splitting corpora 
- BNC: 100 million, 5.7 million, 2.4 million, and 1 million

## Feature engineering
- BNC Sum: The sum of all instances of each lemma per synset in the BNC full text
- CHILDES_Rel_Sum: The sum of all instances of each lemma per synset in the CHILDES corpus, devided by the total number of words in the corpus
- CABNC_Per_100k: The frequency occurence of all lemmas per synset, per 100,000 words of the CABNC
- KBNC_Sum: The sum of all instances of each lemma per synset in the KBNC
